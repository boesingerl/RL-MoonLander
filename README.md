# RL-MoonLander

This repository is the result of a course project at EPFL (CS-456 Artificial Neural Networks).

The goal of this project was to teach an agent to play the Lunar Lander game from OpenAI Gym. The agent needs to learn how to land a lunar module safely on the surface of the moon. In order to do so, we use the REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm, with a simple MLP which outputs a distribution over the possible actions.
